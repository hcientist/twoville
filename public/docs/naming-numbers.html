<h2>Naming Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers can be named. When we name our data, our code is easier to understand and easier to change. For example, consider this program in which we name the side length of a rectangle:</p>

<div class="docs-source">side = 10

with viewport
  center = :zero2
  size = [side + 2, side + 2]

with rectangle()
  color = :soggy
  size = [side, side]
  center = :zero2</div>

<p>Naming <code>side</code> makes it easier to see the connection between the viewport and the rectangle's size because they both refer to the same name. We can tell that the rectangle is a square because both the width and height are set to <code>side</code>. Additionally, if we decide to change <code>side</code> to a different number, we only have to edit the first line of our program. Here we change <code>side</code> to 30:</p>

<div class="docs-source">side = 30

with viewport
  center = :zero2
  size = [side + 2, side + 2]

with rectangle()
  color = :soggy
  size = [side, side]
  center = :zero2</div>

<p>If we hadn't named <code>side</code>, our original program would have looked like this:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with viewport
  center = :zero2
  size = [12, 12]

with rectangle()
  color = :soggy
  size = [10, 10]
  center = :zero2</div>

<p>Changing the size of the rectangle in this version of the program would have required us to update four different numbers.</p>

<p>When we name our numbers, we can write our code <em>parametrically</em>. For example, here's a program that uses turtle geometry and a <code>repeat</code> loop to draw a regular polygon whose number of sides depends on parameter <code>n</code>:</p>

<div class="docs-source">n = 3
angle = 360.0 / n

with path()
  color = :lime
  with turtle()
    position = [30, 0]
    heading = 0
  repeat n
    move().distance = 40
    turn().degrees = angle</div>

<p>Try changing <code>n</code>. When <code>n</code> is 3, it draws an equilateral triangle. When <code>n</code> is 4, it draws a square. When <code>n</code> is 5, it draws a pentagon.</p>

<p>We also name <code>angle</code> in this program, which we calculate as <code>360.0 / n</code>. Where does this expression come from? Imagine walking around one of these shapes. You start at one corner and make a complete circuit back to where you started, turning a full 360 degrees. At each of the <code>n</code> corners, you turn 1/<code>n</code> of those 360 degrees.</p>

<p>Here's a challenge for you. Write a program that draws a rectangle that's twice as wide as it is tall. Name your numbers. Once you have a solution, <a href="#naming-numbers-solution" class="docs-link">compare it to ours</a>.</p>
