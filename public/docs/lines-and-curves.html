<h2>Lines and Curves</h2>

<p>What do you call a shape that's half square and half circle? You don't call it anything, because it doesn't have a name. We often think of shapes as pure: all straight lines like a rectangle or all curves like a circle. But some shapes are a mix.</p>

<p>You can create mixed shapes using the <code>path</code> command. A path is built up out of <i>nodes</i>. Some nodes plot straight line segments, and others are curved. The many possible node types of <code>path</code> make it the most complex command in all of Twoville. We'll visit just three of them in this lesson.</p>

<p>To start tracing out a path, you issue a <code>go</code> node and set its <code>position</code> property, like this:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  go.position = :zero</div>

<p>If you run this code, you'll see errors. Let's add some color and stroke:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 2
  go.position = :zero</div>

<p>Run this code, and you'll see no errors and no nothing. You need at least two nodes in a path before we see any stroke. You need at least three before we see any of its fill color. To create a straight edge, issue a <code>line</code> node:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 2
  go.position = :zero
  line.position = [100, 0]</div>

<p>Do you see a line? I hope so. Let's make another line segment:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 2
  go.position = :zero
  line.position = [100, 0]
  line.position = [100, 50]</div>

<p>Do you see two edges and a filled triangle? If so, let's proceed by adding a semi-circular curve across the top. The <code>arc</code> draws a curve defined by several properties. This code draws an arc starting from [100, 50] and going 180 degrees around a circle centered at [50, 50]:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 2
  go.position = :zero
  line.position = [100, 0]
  line.position = [100, 50]
  arc
    center = [50, 50]
    degrees = 180</div>

<p>The <code>arc</code> has its center pinned down. There may come a day where you find it easier to think about where the curve ends rather than its center. You can use the <code>position</code> property on that day, like this:

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 2
  go.position = :zero
  line.position = [100, 0]
  line.position = [100, 50]
  arc
    position = [0, 50]
    degrees = 180</div>

<p>The result is the same. Just a heads-up. You can't set both <code>position</code> and <code>center</code>.</p>

<p>How does the shape look now? There's a piece of stroke missing on the left side, you say? Let's fix that. Add a <code>back</code> node to the path automatically insert a line segment connect the last node to the first:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  color = :soggy
  stroke
    color = :black
    weight = 1
  go.position = :zero
  line.position = [100, 0]
  line.position = [100, 50]
  arc
    center = [50, 50]
    degrees = 180
  back</div>

<p>There's our half-square, half-circle. You could call it a tombstone, maybe.</p>
