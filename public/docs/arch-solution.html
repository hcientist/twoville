<h2>Arch Solution</h2>

<p>Here is one way to create the arch design:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  stroke
    color = :pink
    weight = 2
  color = [1, 0.75, 1]
  go.position = [20, 0]
  quadratic
    position = [80, 0]
    control = [50, 110]
  line.position = [100, 0]
  quadratic
    position = :zero
    control = [50, 150]
  back</div>

<p>After the original parabola, a <code>line</code> extends to the bottom-right corner. Then a quadratic curve jumps all the way to the bottom-left corner. A <code>back</code> node connects the last node to the first. Finally, the <code>opacity</code> is removed and the whole thing is filled with a lighter pink.</p>
