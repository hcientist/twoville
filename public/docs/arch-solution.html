<h2>Arch Solution</h2>

<p>Here is one way to create the arch design:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with path()
  color = :pink
  closed = true
  jump().position = [20, 0]
  with quadratic()
    position = [80, 0]
    control = [50, 110]
  line().position = [100, 0]
  with quadratic()
    position = [0, 0]
    control = [50, 150]</div>

<p>A <code>line</code> extends to the bottom-right corner. Then a quadratic curve jumps all the way to the bottom-left corner. To connect the last node to the first, the <code>closed</code> property is set. Finally, the stroke is removed and the whole thing is filled with pink.</p>
