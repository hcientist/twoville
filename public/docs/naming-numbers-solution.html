<h2>Wide Rectangle</h2>

<p>Here is one way to create a rectangle that's twice as wide as it as tall:</p>

<div class="docs-source">height = 10
width = 2 * height

view
  center = :zero
  size = [width + 2, height + 2]

rectangle
  color = [0.7, 0.4, 0.5]
  center = :zero
  size = [width, height]</div>
