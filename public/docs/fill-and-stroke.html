<h2>Fill and Stroke</h2>

<p>You've made a circle that was colored cornflower and a rectangle that was colored crimson. Did you try using other colors?</p>

<p>Many colors are named: <code>:red</code>, <code>:yellow</code>, <code>:magenta</code>, <code>:blue</code>, and so on. Not all of them are named, however. You can get at these unnamed colors using a color list.</p>

<p>Color lists are mixtures of three primary colors: red, green, and blue. They have the form <code>[red, green, blue]</code>, where <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, and <code>blue</code> are numbers between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The symbol <code>:red</code> is shorthand for <code>[1, 0, 0]</code>. The symbol <code>:green</code> is shorthand for <code>[0, 1, 0]</code>. The symbol <code>:blue</code> is shorthand for <code>[0, 0, 1]</code>.</p>

<p>To mix together a lot of red, some green, and no blue, we'd write <code>[1, 0.5, 0]</code>. What color is the world that uses this list?</p>

<div class="docs-source">with circle()
  radius = 40
  center = [50, 50]
  color = [1, 0.5, 0]</div>

<p>Color lists are definitely something that you should experiment with.</p>

<p>A shape's <code>color</code> property sets the shape's <i>fill color</i>, which is the color that appears within the shape's perimeter. To set the color of the shape's perimeter itself, you set the <i>stroke color</i>. You also need to set the stroke size, which is 0 by default. Tweak your program to look like this.</p>

<div class="docs-source">with circle()
  radius = 40
  center = [50, 50]
  color = [1, 0.5, 0]
  stroke.color = :black
  stroke.size = 1</div>

<p>Here's a challenge for you. What color list is <code>:black</code> short for?</p>
