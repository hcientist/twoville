<h2>Hello, World</h2>
</div>

<p>Many first programs print "Hello, world!" to a terminal. Where is this world? There isn't one. It's an illusion to make the programmer feel like fame and power are just a few keystrokes away. They aren't. It takes a lot of time and energy to get the world to listen.</p>

<p>In Twoville, on the other hand, you greet the world by making your own. Most worlds are kind of round, so let's make a circle. Insert the following code in the editor.</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world = circle()</pre>

<p>This line is an <i>assignment</i>. A circle is made and assigned to the variable <var>world</var>.</p>

<p>Run this code by clicking on the triangle button. An error reports that you haven't defined the circle's center. In fact, there are three properties that you haven't defined. Add these assignment statements below your first.</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world.center = [50, 50]
world.radius = 40
world.color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>Run the program again. There's your world. It's all ocean, which makes the fish happy.</p>
