<h2>Hello, World</h2>
</div>

<p>Many first programs print "Hello, world!" to a terminal. Where is this world? There isn't one. It's an illusion to make the programmer feel like fame and power are just a few keystrokes away. They aren't. It takes a lot of time and energy to get the world to listen.</p>

<p>In Twoville, on the other hand, you greet a world that you make. Most worlds are kind of round, so let's fashion yours as a circle. Insert the following code in the editor.</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world = circle()</pre>

<p>This line is an <i>assignment</i>. A circle is made and assigned to the variable <code>world</code>.</p>

<p>Run this code by clicking on the Run button, which looks like this:</p>

<p>An error reports that you haven't defined the circle's center. In fact, there are three properties that you haven't defined. Add these assignment statements below your first.</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world.center = [50, 50]
world.radius = 40
world.color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>Run the program again. There's your world. It's all ocean, which makes the fish happy.</p>

<p>Click and drag on the canvas where the circle appears. Do you see how you can move the scene around? This action is called <i>panning</i>. Scroll your mouse or touchpad. Do you see how the scene gets bigger or smaller? This action is called <i>zooming</i>.</p>

<p>To reset the panning and zooming, click the Fit button, which looks like this:</p>

<p>This is a good time to say, "Hello, world."</p>
