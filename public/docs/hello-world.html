<h2>Hello, World</h2>

<p>Many new coders start their journey into code by getting the computer to print "Hello, world!" Where is this world? It's only the programmer and the computer staring at each other.</p>

<p>In Twoville, on the other hand, you greet a world that you make. Most worlds are kind of round, so let's fashion yours as a circle. Insert the following code in the editor.</p>

<div class="docs-source">world = circle</div>

<p>This line is an <i>assignment</i>. A circle is made and given the name <code>world</code>.</p>

<p>Execute this code by clicking on the Run button, which looks like this:</p>

<p>An error reports that you haven't defined the circle's radius. In fact, there are three properties that you haven't defined. Add these assignment statements below your first.</p>

<div class="docs-source">world.center = [50, 50]
world.radius = 40
world.color = :cornflower</div>

<p>Run the program again. There's your world. It's all ocean, which makes the fish happy.</p>

<p>Click and drag on the canvas where the circle appears. Do you see how you can move the scene around? This action is called <i>panning</i>. Scroll your mouse or touchpad. Do you see how the scene gets bigger or smaller? This action is called <i>zooming</i>.</p>

<p>To reset the view after panning and zooming, click the Fit button, which looks like this:</p>

<p>Now's a good time to say hello to your world.</p>
