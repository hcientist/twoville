<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>You've seen that there are many colors in Twoville that have been named. These names can make the code easier to read. When you set a color property to <code>[1, 0.388, 0.278]</code>, most of us would have no idea what color would appear. But when you use <code>:tomato</code>, we can make a reasonable prediction.</p>

<p>When you use a name of the form <code>:name</code>, you are using a <em>constant</em> that is built in to the Twoville language. There are a number of constants. Some are used only with the certain commands, and you will learn about them when you learn about the commands. Others are more general, like these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>:zero2</code>, which is <code>[0, 0]</code></li>
  <li><code>:up</code>, which is <code>[0, 1]</code></li>
  <li><code>:down</code>, which is <code>[0, -1]</code></li>
  <li><code>:right</code>, which is <code>[1, 0]</code></li>
  <li><code>:left</code>, which is <code>[-1, 0]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In the code you write, you are free to choose between the named form and the value form. In these notes, you will find us favoring the names. For example, we will often use <code>:zero2</code> for positions.</p>
