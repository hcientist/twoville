<h2>Viewport</h2>

<p>Delete any code in the code editor, run your blank program, hit the fit button, and zoom out a bit. Do you see that faint rectangular outline? That rectangular outline marks the <i>viewport</i>.</p>

<p>Anything inside the viewport will be visible when you bring your design into other programs. Anything outside the viewport will be cut off.</p>

<p>For example, consider this Twoville program:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with circle()
  color = :yellow
  center = [0, 50]
  radius = 50</div>

<p>Half the circle lies outside the viewport. When you export the SVG file and embed it in a web page, it looks like this:</p>

<img src="/docs/images/viewport_clip.svg" class="docs-image">

<p>Within Twoville itself, you can see both inside and outside the viewport.</p>

<p>By default, the viewport's bottom-left corner is (0, 0) and its top-right corner is (100, 100). If you want a shape to be visible, it must reside in this coordinate system&mdash;or you must change the coordinate system.</p>

<p>To change the coordinate system, you set properties of the builtin <code>viewport</code> object. It has properties <code>corner</code>, <code>center</code>, and <code>size</code>, just like rectangles.</p>

<p>In the following code we set the size of the viewport to fit around the magenta rectangle.</p>

<div class="docs-source">viewport.size = [40, 30]

with rectangle()
  corner = [5, 5]
  size = [30, 20]
  color = :magenta</div>

<p>If you want to set multiple properties, the <code>viewport</code> object can be used in a <code>with</code> block.</p>

<div class="docs-source">with viewport
  size = [40, 30]
  center = [20, 15]

with rectangle()
  corner = [5, 5]
  size = [30, 20]
  color = :magenta</div>

<p>Note that you do not put any parentheses after <code>viewport</code> like you did with <code>rectangle</code> and <code>circle</code>. The parentheses are used when you are making something new. You are not making a new viewport; you are tweaking the existing one.</p>

<h3>Grid Lines</h3>

<p>You may find it useful to plot a grid on your viewport, which you can do by setting the <code>grid</code> property to a list of two numbers. The list <code>[1, 1]</code> plots a grid line on every whole number x-coordinate and y-coordinate. The list <code>[2, 5]</code> plots a line on every even x-coordinate and every y-coordinate that's a multiple of 5.</p>

<p>This viewport plots a grid line every 2 units on both axes:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with viewport
  size = [10, 10]
  grid = [2, 2]</div>
