<h2>B&eacute;zier Curves</h2>

<p>When you add a <code>line</code> node to a path, you get a straight line segment. When you add an <code>arc</code> node, you get a circular arc. You can make a lot of interesting shapes by mixing these together. But what about something like this?</p>

<p>There aren't any straight lines on that shape, and the curves don't look very circular. In fact, this path was drawn using neither of these node types. This shape is made of quadratic B&eacute;zier curves. (B&eacute;zier is a French name that is pronounced like <i>BEZ yay</i>.)</p>

<p>To plot a quadratic B&eacute;zier curve, you need its two endpoints and a third point that acts like a black hole pulling the line connecting the two endpoints toward it with gravitational force. This black hole is called a <i>control point</i>.</p>

<p>Consider this code that plots a <i>parabola</i>:</p>

<div class="docs-source">path
  stroke
    color = :pink
    weight = 2
  opacity = 0
  go.position = [20, 0]
  quadratic
    position = [80, 0]
    control = [50, 110]</div>

<p>The <code>go</code> node establishes the starting endpoint at [20, 0]. Put your cursor on its code in the text editor and drag around on its handle. The <code>quadratic</code> node adds a curve that ends at [80, 0]. Instead of a straight line connecting these two positions, the control point [50, 110] drags the curve upward. Put your cursor on its code. You'll see two handles appear. Move the control point's handle to see how the black hole pulls the line toward it.</p>

<p>Here's a challenge for you. Add a <code>line</code> and another <code>quadratic</code> to make this arch:</p>
