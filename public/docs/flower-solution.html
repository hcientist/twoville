<h2>Flower Solution</h2>

<p>Here is one way to create the flower-ish design.</p>

<div class="docs-source">circle
  center = [50, 75]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

circle
  center = [75, 50]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

circle
  center = [50, 25]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

circle
  center = [25, 50]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange</div>

<p>Notice how there is a lot of repetition? All four circles have the same <code>radius</code> and <code>color</code>. Only the <code>center</code> property changes.</p>

<p>If you name all the circles with assignment statements, you can use a block to set the shared properties on all four circles at the same time. The subject of the block is a list of all the circles.</p>

<div class="docs-source">n = circle
  center = [50, 75]
e = circle
  center = [75, 50]
s = circle
  center = [50, 25]
w = circle
  center = [25, 50]

[n, e, s, w]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange</div>

<p>This compact solution makes it much easier to change the radius or the color. You only have to make changes in one spot, not four.</p>
