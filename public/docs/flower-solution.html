<h2>Flower Solution</h2>

<p>Here is one way to create the flower-ish design.</p>

<div class="docs-source">with circle()
  center = [50, 75]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

with circle()
  center = [75, 50]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

with circle()
  center = [50, 25]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange

with circle()
  center = [25, 50]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange</div>

<p>Notice how there is a lot of repetition? All four circles have the same <code>radius</code> and <code>color</code>. Only the <code>center</code> property changes.</p>

<p>If you name all the circles with assignment statements, you can use another form of the <code>with</code> command to set the shared properties on all four circles at the same time. For the subject of this <code>with</code> command, provide a list of all the circles, like so:</p>

<div class="docs-source">n = with circle()
  center = [50, 75]
e = with circle()
  center = [75, 50]
s = with circle()
  center = [50, 25]
w = with circle()
  center = [25, 50]

with [n, e, s, w]
  radius = 25
  color = :orange</div>

<p>This compact solution makes it much easier to change the radius or the color. You only have to make changes in one spot, not four.</p>
