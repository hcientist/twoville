<h2>Polygon</h2>

<p>Just as a polyline is a line with many segments, a polygon is a shape with many sides. The two are constructed in the same way: as a list of vertices. This program draws an orange, pentagonal house-like shape with a rounded black stroke:</p>

<div class="docs-source">polygon
  color = :orange
  vertex.position = [10, 10]
  vertex.position = [90, 10]
  vertex.position = [90, 60]
  vertex.position = [50, 90]
  vertex.position = [10, 60]
  stroke
    color = :black
    size = 5
    join = :round</div>

<p>Here's a challenge for you. Write a program that uses one <code>polygon</code> command and generates these these two mountains on the horizon:</p>
