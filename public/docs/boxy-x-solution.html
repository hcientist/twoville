  color = :orange
  turtle
    position = :zero
    heading = 0
  repeat 4
    walk.distance = 35
    turn.degrees = 90
    walk.distance = 30
    turn.degrees = -90
    walk.distance = 100 - 2 * 35
    turn.degrees = -90
    walk.distance = 30
    turn.degrees = 90
    walk.distance = 35
    turn.degrees = 90</div>
