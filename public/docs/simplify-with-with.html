<h2>Simplify With With</h2>

<p>That's no typo. Twoville has a <code>with</code> command that can make creating shapes a little simpler. Recall the code that you used to make your world:</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world = circle()
world.center = [50, 50]
world.radius = 40
world.color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>We reached inside <code>world</code> three different times to assign its three properties: <code>center</code>, <code>radius</code>, and <code>color</code>. Using <code>with</code>, we can shorten these assignments:

<pre class="docs-source">world = circle()
with world
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>The <code>with</code> command makes <code>world</code> the subject of the three assignment statements. Do you think that's easier to read and write? You don't have to think so. The benefits of <code>with</code> may become more apparent as we assign more and more properties.</p>

<p>Notice how the three assignments have been indented. This indentation is required to show that the assignments belong to the <code>with</code> command.</p>

<p>If our shape is used only in the <code>with</code> command, as is the case for <code>world</code>, we don't even need to assign it to a variable. You can directly make an unnamed circle the subject:</p>

<pre class="docs-source">with circle()
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>That said, meaningful names make our code easier to understand. If you still want to name your world, either for its meaningfulness or to reference it later, you can use <code>with</code> in an assignment statement:</p>

<pre class="docs-source">world = with circle()
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</pre>

<p>Hello, unnamed circle. Hello, <code>world</code>. Either way.</p>
