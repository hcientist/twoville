<h2>Simplify With Blocks</h2>

<p>Assigning a shape's properties can get wordy. Remember this code that you used to make your world?</p>

<div class="docs-source">world = circle
world.center = [50, 50]
world.radius = 40
world.color = :cornflower</div>

<p>We reached inside <code>world</code> three different times to assign its three properties: <code>center</code>, <code>radius</code>, and <code>color</code>. Using a block, you can shorten these assignments:

<div class="docs-source">world = circle
world
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</div>

<p>A block is sequence of statements that appears after a shape. The block makes <code>world</code> the subject of the three assignment statements. Do you think this code is easier to read and write? You don't have to think so.</p>

<p>Notice how the three assignments have been indented. This indentation is required to show that the assignments belong to the shape.</p>

<p>If your shape is used only by the block, you don't even need to assign it to a variable. You can directly make an unnamed circle the subject of the block:</p>

<div class="docs-source">circle
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</div>

<p>That said, meaningful names make our code easier to understand. If you still want to name your world, either for its meaningfulness or to refer back to it later, you can combine the block and the assignment statement:</p>

<div class="docs-source">world = circle
  center = [50, 50]
  radius = 40
  color = :cornflower</div>

<p>Hello, unnamed circle. Hello, <code>world</code>. Either way.</p>
