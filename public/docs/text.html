<h2>Text</h2>

<p>Sooner or later, you will need to make a treasure map. Treasure maps are full of pictures of trees and piranhas and rocks, but they also have text labels. To draw text in Twoville, use the <code>text</code> command. There are several properties that you need to set on a <code>text</code> object:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the <code>message</code> containing the letters, numbers, and other symbols of text</li>
	<li>the <code>color</code> of the text</li>
	<li>the <code>size</code> of the text</li>
	<li>the <code>position</code> of the text</li>
</ul>

<p>In this program we mark the location of some gold using the <code>text</code> command and a black dot:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with viewport
  size = [100, 40]
  corner = [0, 30]

position = [50, 50]

with circle()
  center = position
  radius = 3
  color = :black

with text()
  message = "gold"
	size = 16
  position = position
  color = :orange</div>

<p>Run it. Notice how the text and circle have the same position. The text is anchored to this position just as your pirate ship is anchored to its place in the sea. By default, the point of the text that serves as the anchor is the bottom center of the letters. You'll occasionally want the anchor to be in a different spot on the text. You can set the location with the <code>anchor</code> property. The <code>anchor</code> is a list of two alignment constants. The first element is the horizontal position and can be <code>:west</code>, <code>:center</code>, or <code>:east</code>. The second element is the vertical position and can be <code>:north</code>, <code>:center</code>, or <code>:south</code>.</p>

<p>All told, there are these nine possible anchorings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:west, :north]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-west-north.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:center, :north]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-center-north.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:east, :north]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-east-north.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:west, :center]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-west-center.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:center, :center]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-center-center.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:east, :center]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-east-center.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:west, :south]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-west-south.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:center, :south]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-center-south.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>anchor = [:east, :south]</code>
		<img src="/docs/images/text-east-south.svg" class="docs-image docs-li-image over-white">
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>text</code> command also works on drawings that aren't treasure maps.</p>
