<h2>Ungon</h2>

<p>Corners are alright. But have you ever tried not having corners? If not, consider plotting an <code>ungon</code> some time. Ungons are like polygons, but their vertices are rounded off. This means they are "not polygons."</p>

<p>Here's the pentagonal house again, but this time it uses the <code>ungon</code> command:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with ungon()
  formula = :symmetric
  color = :orange
  vertex().position = [10, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 60]
  vertex().position = [50, 90]
  vertex().position = [10, 60]</div>

<p>This ungon is symmetric, which means the corners are rounded off all the way to the midpoints of the edges.</p>

<p>An ungon with absolute rounding shaves off only a fixed length of each edge around a corner. If an ungon's <code>formula</code> property is <code>absolute</code>, it must also have its <code>rounding</code> property set. Here we shave off 5 units from each edge:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with ungon()
  formula = :absolute
  rounding = 5
  color = :orange
  vertex().position = [10, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 60]
  vertex().position = [50, 90]
  vertex().position = [10, 60]</div>

<p>An ungon with relativing rounding (whose <code>formula</code> property is set to <code>relative</code>) shaves off a proportion of each edge around a corner. Here we shave off 25% of each edge:</p>

<div class="docs-source">with ungon()
  formula = :relative
  rounding = 0.25
  color = :orange
  vertex().position = [10, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 10]
  vertex().position = [90, 60]
  vertex().position = [50, 90]
  vertex().position = [10, 60]</div>

<p>If you use a number outside of [0, 1], be prepared for strange effects.</p>
